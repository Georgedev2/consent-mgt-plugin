# Consent Management Plugin

This module (Consent Management Plugin) was bootstrapped with create-react-app.

The module is a responsive consent management plugin or module that show a simple box over a website. 

The module or plugin when displayed stop scrolling and click interactions on the website until the accept button is on the plugin is clicked.

The plugin has a simple “Accept”  and a  “Reject” button 

The ACCEPT button unblocks the site, allows the user the scroll, and also minimizes the plugin.

The  “REJECT” button that takes the user to another view with some text in it, and a navigation within it that returns the user to the previous view containing “Accept”  and a  “Reject” button 

The “Reject” button when clicked also disable Google analytics scripts on the page.
